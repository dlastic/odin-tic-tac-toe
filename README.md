# Tic-tac-toe

This is a **Tic-tac-toe** game built as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It allows two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3Ã—3 board. The game tracks turns, checks for a winner or a tie, and displays the current game status.

This project focuses on **modular JavaScript**, DOM manipulation, and game logic design, using factory functions and the module pattern to structure the code cleanly and minimize global variables.

Play the game [here](https://dlastic.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/).

## Features

- **Win and Tie Detection**: Detects win conditions and tie state.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Uses factory functions and IIFEs to organize logic.
- **Dynamic Messaging**: Displays whose turn it is or who has won.
- **Restart Functionality**: Lets players reset the board and start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Layout for the board and controls.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game grid and message area.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and UI updates.
